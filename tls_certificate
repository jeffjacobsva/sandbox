First, you must have GitBash installed. If you need it, get it from here: 
•	https://git-scm.com/downloads/win
•	Choose the Git for Windows/x64 Setup
•	Download the installer & run on your GFE – accept all defaults

Then, you need to run a gitbash terminal window (you just installed this!)
•	By default, it is under [Start] -> All -> GIT -> Git Bash

Next, in Git Bash (which is a CLI) create the folder where you will store your key. Enter the commands as shown:
•	cd ~/OneDrive\ -\ Department\ of\ Veterans\ Affairs/Documents/
- if this fails use: cd ~/Documents/ instead, thought it won’t be saved as part of your profile
•	mkdir myTLS-ID
•	cd myTLS-ID

Create your TLS identity (certificate and key) by entering the following commands:
•	openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -keyout ca-key-[Your 3 Initials].pem -out ca-cert-[Your 3 Initials].pem

You will see random characters (part of a random data key creation algorithm), then a prompt:
•	Enter PEM pass phrase:

Enter in a pass phrase – be sure to make it something memorable… I for one use my PIV card authentication digits, you are free to put anything you like – just don’t forget it: you will need it EVERY TIME you use this key for authentication!
Enter it in a second time to confirm.
Then you will be prompted to enter information about your Identity:
Enter the data in bold, though this is the information for me! Yours should be whatever is appropriate for you! – items in italics are descriptions of what goes there
               Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: US [you live here]
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Florida [you live here]
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Land O Lakes [you live here]
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:vhaispmcalld [your VA ID goes here]
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:[nothing needed here]
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Dan McAllister [use your own name - only in very rare circumstances with this also be you]
Email Address []:daniel.mcallister@va.gov [use your own VA email here]

When you press enter after your email address entry, you will either get an error message or just a prompt. The latter of which means it worked.
Look in your folder and you should see just 2 files:
•	ls

The file ca-cert-zzz.pem is the Certificate you need to send, via email, to CM to enter it into the Key Vault for the mTLS connections you’re trying to test or work with. The email address is: OITConfigMgrPED@va.gov
NOTE: the “zzz” in the file name will actually have your initials – see the openssl command above, that is where you defined this filename! You can rename and/or move the files without re-generating the certificate.

When you launch your application to connect to the mTLS authenticated portal, you will point back to this folder (the KEY file, not the PEM file!), and you should be prompted for your password in order to authenticate…. That is, the password you set in these instructions (not your CyberArk password, bank password, or any other password – unless your are re-using passwords!)
